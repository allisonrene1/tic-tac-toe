# tic-tac-toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game with a cute UI. Both the "go first" and "go second" buttons
are fully functional and take into account a winning situation from either the human user or the computer.
A tie condition between the human and the computer is also evaluated and accounted for.

I will be implementing a recursive, MiniMax algorithm which will allow the computer
to evaluate the best move against the human user for an optimal and speedy winning condition.

Stay tuned for that (⊙ˍ⊙)

Side note: Code is not modular, with ongoing DRY violations. Will be refactored to take care of that.
